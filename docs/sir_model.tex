\subsection{SIR Model}
Our basic stochastic SIR model relies on the assumptions that every person in an environment can be modeled as a point value, which has a location (i.e.\ GPS coordinates) and an infection state. These states can be either \textit{susceptible} (S), \textit{infected} (I), \textit{recovered} (R) or in advanced models also \textit{under quarantine} (Q) or \textit{dead} (D). All individuals, here called agents, have a probability (here called diffusion rate $d$ to make a step per time step on a predefined grid. In the case, that some agents meet at the same location, disease spreading can occur. An infected agent spreads the disease with probability $\beta$ to all the agents in its close vicinity (same location on the grid). Furthermore recovery is covered by taking a recovery rate into account, i.e.\ a probability $\gamma$ to recover from the disease per time step. If an infected agent recovers from the disease, the state of the agent changes from \textit{infected} to \textit{recovered}, which is definite (no double infections). The process ends, when no infected agents are left.

An example of a early model state is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:1}

    \label{fig:1}
\end{figure}

In this case, 1000 agents were initialized on a 100 by 100 grid, where a certain amount of infected agents were introduced as a seed. Letting the agents perform random walks on the grid (maximally one step each time step with probability $d$), and letting the model converge, the results in figure~\ref{fig:2} can be observed.

    \label{fig:2}
\end{figure}

With the above stated parameters ($d=0.8$, $\beta=0.6$, $\gamma=0.01$), the disease does not spread over the whole population. However over 80\% were infected over time, which could be a very likely scenario of the corona out brake.
