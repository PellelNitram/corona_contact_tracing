\subsection{Graphs and graph convolutions}

Graphs are sets of nodes connected by edges, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:graph_example}

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption{Example graph.}

\end{figure}

We model partially infected populations as a graph, where each individual (interchangeably called agent) is a node. Edges of this graph model contacts between two agents. The dynamics of infections throughout the population is described by graph convolutions. The definition of a graph convolution~\cite{Kipf2017SemiSupervisedCW} for here is

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:graph_convolution}
	h_{v_i}^{(l+1)} = \sum_{j\in A(i)} h_{v_j}^{(l)}
\end{equation}

with $h_{v_i}^{(l)}$ denoting the feature vector of node $i$ of iteration $(l)$ and $A(i)$ as all neighbours of node $i$ as described by the adjacency matrix $A$. This formulation is equivalent to the matrix formulation $h^{(l+1)} = A h^{(l)}$ with $A$ as adjacency matrix as shown in \ref{sec:consistency}. We consider here adjacency matrices without diagonal elements.

Each agent $i$ is modeled by $D$ features, $h_{v_i} \in \mathbb{R}^D$. Therefore, the feature matrix, $h^{(l)}$, consists of all agents' features at time $(l)$ and is thereby of dimension $N\times D$ where there are $N$ agents in the population and each agent is described by $D$ features. A three dimensional feature space is used in this work, $D=3$, modeling three possible health states. The unit vectors of this space are interpreted as following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\vec{e}_0$: susceptible state
	\item $\vec{e}_1$: infected state
	\item $\vec{e}_2$: recovered state
\end{itemize}
A uniform distribution over these possible states expresses complete uncertainty of the health state of an agent.

\subsection{SIR Model}

Our basic stochastic SIR model relies on the assumptions that every person in an environment can be modeled as a point value, which has a location (i.e.\ GPS coordinates) and an infection state. These states can be either \textit{susceptible} (S), \textit{infected} (I), \textit{recovered} (R) or in advanced models also \textit{under quarantine} (Q) or \textit{dead} (D). All individuals, here called agents, have a probability (here called diffusion rate $d$ to make a step per time step on a predefined grid. In the case, that some agents meet at the same location, disease spreading can occur. An infected agent spreads the disease with probability $\beta$ to all the agents in its close vicinity (same location on the grid). Furthermore recovery is covered by taking a recovery rate into account, i.e.\ a probability $\gamma$ to recover from the disease per time step. If an infected agent recovers from the disease, the state of the agent changes from \textit{infected} to \textit{recovered}, which is definite (no double infections). The process ends, when no infected agents are left.
\begin{center}
	Susceptibles $\overset{\beta}{\longrightarrow}$ Infected $\overset{\gamma}{\longrightarrow}$ Recovered.
\end{center}

An example of a early model state is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:1}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{initial_setup.png}
	\caption{Early state of SIR model, blue dots = susceptibles, red dots = infected agents, green dots = Recovered agents}%
	\label{fig:1}
\end{figure}

In this case, 1000 agents were initialized on a 100 by 100 grid, where a certain amount of infected agents were introduced as a seed. Letting the agents perform random walks on the grid (maximally one step each time step with probability $d$), and letting the model converge, the results in figure~\ref{fig:2} can be observed.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{1_1000_agents}
	\caption{Plot of the proportions of susceptible (blue), infected (red) and recovered (green) individuals in each state over time.}%
	\label{fig:2}
\end{figure}

With the above stated parameters ($d=0.8$, $\beta=0.6$, $\gamma=0.01$), the disease does not spread over the whole population. However over 80\% were infected over time, which could be a very likely scenario of the corona out brake.

\subsection{Improving the Simulation}
Random walk is commonly used for simple Simulations. However this movement pattern does not represent the daily routine of the majority of citizens. It  is more likely that the major part of the population moves around their hometown and travel small distances which leads to clustering of the whole population. To improve the simulation the agents are split into two groups. One group moves random walk like. This group represents e.g. service providers and delivery services. The other group moves around given points. This movement is implemented using polar coordinates with random radius and random angle. The movement pattern of the two groups is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:movementPattern}. 
\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{docs/movementPattern.png}
	\caption{Movement pattern of the two groups. Random walk (orange) and localized movement (blue)}%
	\label{fig:movementPattern}
\end{figure}

With these two groups new features like multiple outbreaks of the waves in different clusters can be observed. An example of the improved model is shown in figure \ref{fig:multipleOutbreaks}
