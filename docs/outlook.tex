\section{Disease Spread Reduction with Minimal Intervention}
This section presents approaches to optimally reduce the spread of the disease with minimal intervention.

\subsubsection{Edge Cutting Analysis}
All non pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) can be understood as some kind of edge removal in our graph-based approach:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Isolation of an infected individual removes all of its edges with very high probability.
	\item Quarantine of a contact person removes all of its edges with high probability.
	\item Social distancing removes some edges of of many individuals.
	\item Cancellation of large events remove many edges of many individuals.
\end{itemize}
As a first step analyse the effect of these measures in $R_0$.
$R_0$ models how many people are infected by a single infected person.
It is crucial to constrain $R_0$ below zero to avoid exponential growth in the number of infected individuals.


As future work we would like to explore ways to calculate the minimal set of edge removals which reduces the $R_0$ value of the pandemic below $1$.

In our approach $R_0$ can be derived from the ratio of infected people of $H^{(t+1)}$ and of $H^{(t)}$:
\begin{equation}
	R_0 = \frac{\norm{H^{(t+1)}\mid_{m=1}}_{0}}{\norm{H^{(t)}\mid_{m=1}}_{0}} %#TODO betrag
\end{equation}

The square matrix $C$ with dimensions $N \times N$ models desirable edge cancellations.
Note, that this matrix does not have to know the edges of a future time step, it only expresses which edges must not exist.
It is multiplied element-wise onto the adjacency matrix $A$, thus $\bar{A} = A \odot C$ describes a adjacency matrix with applied cancellations.

To optimally limit the spread of the disease, we seek to minimize the number of cancellations $\norm{C}_0$, given that $R_0$ is below zero:
\begin{equation}
	\max_{C} \norm{C}_0\text{, s.t. }R_0 < 1
\end{equation}

TODO: Derive an expanded statement from the above formulation.\\
% Future Work: This would be more powerful, if there would be some different kinds of edges (social, work, education, large events, etc.)\\
% Future Work: This only takes the current time step into account but it would be desirable to look even further into the future.

\subsubsection{Test Prioritization}
When tests are limited, they should be used to discover as much as possible about the health state of the overall population.
This in turn allows to reduce the $R_0$ value in further time steps as edge cutting is more efficient.

Lets assume there are $t_{\text{max}}$ tests per time step.
A test reveals the true health state of an individual (ignoring false negatives and false positives)
\begin{equation}
	h^{(t)} \xrightarrow{\text{test}} h^{(t+1)} \in \{\vec{e}_0, \vec{e}_1, \vec{e}_2 \}
\end{equation}

The test assignment $T$ with dimension $N$ is a binary variable describing which individuals should be tested.
