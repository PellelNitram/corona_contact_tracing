# Corona Contact Tracing

Package for evaluating Corona traces from people's mobility data.

This package aims to do the following things

- Effectively identify contact persons based on time stamped location histories
- Identify contact persons with many secondary contact persons to prioritize them during testing.
This should serve as an early detection of super spreading events.

It uses an existing stochastic SIR simulation to generate data sets.
These data sets are presented in a csv table, its headers are described in the repo.
Next pairwise distances are evaluated and multiple informations derived from this information.
These informations should be utilized to slow down the pandemic.

This package was created within the #WirVsVirus Hackathon of the German government and is Work in Progress!
